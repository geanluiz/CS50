            <h3>Types of Fixed Income Investments</h3>
            <p>Fixed income investments involve lending money to an issuer, such as a bank, company, or government, in exchange for a return over a specified period.</p>
            <p>These investments are generally considered lower risk compared to variable income investments, but they also offer lower earning potential,
                reflecting the classic Risk vs. Return relationship. </p>
            <p>Fixed income securities can be categorized as pre-fixed (where the return is known before investing),
                post-fixed (where the return is linked to economic indexes), or hybrid (a combination of both).</p>

            <h5>Savings</h5>
            <p>Savings accounts are one of the most popular investment options in Brazil, with over 240 million accounts holding nearly R$1 trillion as of December 2022.
                They are exempt from income tax and have no minimum investment requirement, but their returns are limited and tied to the Selic interest rate.</p>

            <h5>Direct Treasury</h5>
            <p>Tesouro Direto is a program that allows individuals to invest in government bonds, effectively lending money to the federal government.
                These bonds can have fixed returns or be linked to economic indicators like inflation (IPCA) and interest rates (Selic).</p>

            <h5>CDB (Bank Deposit Certificate)</h5>
            <p>CDBs are debt securities issued by banks, making the investor a creditor of the bank. The yield can be known at the time of application or linked to economic indicators.
                CDBs are popular among fixed income investors and are guaranteed by the Credit Guarantee Fund (FGC) for amounts up to R$250,000.</p>

            <h5>LCI and LCA (Real Estate and Agribusiness Credit Letters)</h5>
            <p>Both LCI and LCA are issued by financial institutions to finance specific sectorsâ€”real estate and agribusiness, respectively.
                They are also guaranteed by the FGC and are exempt from income tax.</p>

            <h5>CRI and CRA (Real Estate and Agribusiness Receivables Certificates)</h5>
            <p>CRIs and CRAs are similar to LCIs and LCAs but are issued by securitization companies rather than financial institutions.
                These certificates are also exempt from income tax and are used to finance real estate and agribusiness projects.</p>

            <h5>LC (Bills of Exchange)</h5>
            <p>LCs are fixed income investments issued by financial institutions, where investors lend money that can only be used for loans to individuals and companies.
                LCs typically require a higher initial investment and have longer maturity periods.</p>

            <h5>Debentures</h5>
            <p>Debentures are medium to long-term debt securities issued by companies to finance various projects. They can be "normal" debentures, issued by any company,
                or "incentivized" debentures, which are exempt from income tax and are issued for public works projects.</p>

            <h5>Financial Letters</h5>
            <p>Financial Letters are issued by financial institutions seeking long-term resources and are aimed at high-income investors, with a minimum investment requirement
                of R$50,000 and a minimum maturity period of two years.</p>
