            <h3>Types of Variable Income Investments</h3>
            <p>Variable income investments are characterized by their volatility and higher risk compared to fixed income investments.<br>
                This increased risk can lead to higher potential returns, although these returns are not guaranteed.</p>
            <p>Understanding the distinct dynamics and rules of variable income products is essential for investors. Below, we explore the main types of variable income investments.</p>

            <h5>Stocks</h5>
            <p>Stocks represent a portion of a company's share capital and are the smallest unit of ownership in a company.<br>
                When you buy a share, you become a part-owner and gain certain rights, such as receiving dividends, which are portions of the company's profits.</p>
            <p>Investors can generate returns from stocks in two primary ways: through the appreciation of the share's value and through dividends or interest on equity (JCP).<br>
                The appreciation occurs when the market values the shares at a higher price than what the investor initially paid.</p>
            <p>Shares are purchased on the Stock Exchange through a stockbroker, and while there are various strategies for profiting from stocks, predicting their future value can be challenging.</p>

            <h5>BDRs</h5>
            <p>Brazilian Depositary Receipts (BDRs) are deposit certificates issued and traded in Brazil that represent shares of companies listed on foreign stock exchanges,
                such as NASDAQ and NYSE. BDRs function similarly to common shares but have unique characteristics that differentiate them from traditional stock investments.</p>

            <h5>Investment Funds</h5>
            <p>Investment funds are collective investment vehicles that pool capital from multiple investors to form a diversified portfolio managed by professional fund managers.
                The assets within these funds can include stocks, real estate, government bonds, and more. Funds can be categorized into various types, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed Income Funds: Conservative profile.</li>
                <li>Multimarket Funds: Moderate profile.</li>
                <li>Equity Funds: Aggressive profile.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Additionally, there are foreign exchange and international funds, as well as real estate funds (FIIs), which focus on investing in real estate assets.</p>

            <p>While funds do not have FGC protection, they are registered under their own CNPJ for protection. Each fund is subject to different tax treatments,
                with fixed income funds operating under tax incidence bands and equity funds incurring a 15% income tax.</p>

            <h5>Real Estate Funds</h5>
            <p>Real estate funds, or FIIs, are a popular choice for beginner investors. These funds pool resources from multiple investors to invest exclusively in real estate assets,
                such as commercial buildings, shopping centers, and hospitals. Fund managers are responsible for managing these investments.</p>

            <h5>ETFs</h5>
            <p>Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are funds traded on stock exchanges that track the performance of specific indices, such as the Ibovespa.
                ETFs consist of baskets of stocks and can include both stock and fixed income ETFs, providing investors with diversified exposure to various asset classes.</p>

            <h5>COEs</h5>
            <p>Certificates of Structured Transactions (COEs) are another investment vehicle that allows access to various asset classes, including global funds and US stocks.
                COEs offer the potential for significant returns with controlled risks, and some provide capital protection, ensuring that investors receive their initial investment back in the worst-case scenario.</p>
