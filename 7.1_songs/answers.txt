Based on the averages of energy, valence and danceability
I think the aura of said listener is more to the purple color
because although their top songs have more energy and danceability, they are also a little
introspective as valence shows.
And as per Spotify's definition "Purple auras tune in to get amped up, entertained,
and moving while they navigate the twists and turns of their day."

Yet I don't think just these averages alone are enough to tell a person's personality
as they are just 3 variables. I think we should at least use more caracteristics about the songs,
maybe weigh those variables based on the number of songs as well.
A step further maybe would be to use AI and train it with a user input as to how they fell
when they chose each song.
